# Circulate - Demo App for CircleCI

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-python-flask.svg?style=svg&circle-token=6715e4f37e6b8cee04ea7f1812ac00fb135199f9)](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Public/circleci-demo-python-flask/)

This is a working application that you can use to learn how to build, test and deploy with CircleCI 2.0. Follow the [Project Walkthrough](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/project-walkthrough/) guide here.

It's a 'social blogging' web application similar to Twitter. Users can create accounts, make posts, follow users and comment on posts. You can *circualate* your thoughts and ideas :-)

**Original Author Credit:** This is directly based on Miguel Grinberg's excellent [Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) application.

The application uses Python and Flask for the backend.

**IMPORTANT:**

- You **do not need to know Python to follow the guide** in the CircleCI docs.
- You will not need to install or setup a Python environment to follow the tutorial - you can follow along by making edits to config on GitHub if you wish.
- No matter what language or stack you are going to use with CircleCI, we recommend following the walkthrough first, as it introduces concepts about CircleCI that you can then apply to your own project.

## Deployment to Heroku

The application demonstrates how to deploy to Heroku from CircleCI 2.0. Please consult the [Project Walkthrough](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/project-walkthrough/) for documentation
